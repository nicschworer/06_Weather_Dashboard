# 06_Weather_Dashboard

LINK to app: 

This assignment was focused on using the OpenWeather API to pull in current and forecasted weather for a city when you search on that city's name. 
Once you search that city and retrieve the weather data, that information is shown on the page (temp, humidity, UV Index {shown in green, yellow or red to indicate severity} for both current and the 5 coming days. That city is also added to your local storage and local storage items are pulled to create buttons for recently searched cities which, when clicked, will pull up the current and forecasted weather for that city again. 

Here are some photos:
